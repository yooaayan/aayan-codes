    <h1>Features of Apple iphone 16 </h1>
    <p> Just like last year, the iPhone 16 models have a 48-megapixel (ƒ/1.6 aperture for iPhone 16 and 16 Plus, ƒ/1.78 for 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max) wide-angle main camera that Apple has dubbed a “Fusion” camera. It’s capable of taking 48-megapixel pictures, albeit without full color detail, but it typically takes 24-megapixel pictures.

It also allows a sort of simulated optical zoom of 2x by using just part of the frame. The 12MP zoomed photos it takes work out quite well; most people wouldn't know or care about the fact that there's no true 2x zoom telephoto lens here.

On the Pro phones, Apple is promoting a much faster sensor and shutter speed, which will allow you to take photos that resolve much more quickly. I definitely didn't have any complaints on that front in my time taking a bunch of photos with these phones.

All the phones also have an ultra-wide camera (now 48MP for the first time and ƒ/2.2 on the Pros, still 12MP and ƒ/2.2 aperture on the base 16s). The Pro now takes drastically better low-light photos with this lens than the last-generation even with night mode disabled, as you can see here</p>;
